    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brown some chops, then add vegetables, broth and rice. This dinner only needs one skillet, a knife, a cutting board, some measuring cups and spoons, a can opener, and a mixing and serving spoon. We like this with simple quesadillas and a salad. Add some avocado slices, if you like!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 boneless pork chops, about 3/4-inch thick</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons taco seasoning spice blend</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a 12-inch skillet. Season both sides of pork chops with taco seasoning, cumin, smoked paprika, and salt. </li>
        <li>Place chops in the hot skillet and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Remove to a plate, and keep warm. </li>
        <li>In the same skillet, cook and stir onion and bell pepper, until the vegetables just begin to pick up a little color, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
    </ol>
